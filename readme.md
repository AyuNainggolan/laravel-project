## _Zizaco's_ Laravel Project Template

This is the skeleton of a Laravel application that I use to save the initial setup that I usually make. Feel free to use and to customize according to your needs.

**To create a project from this repository:**

```
git clone --depth=1 --branch=master git@github.com:Zizaco/laravel-project.git <projectName>
cd !$
rm -rf .git
composer run-script post-root-package-install
composer install
composer run-script post-create-project-cmd
```

### What is included

- `laravelcollective/html` package.
- `laravel-elixir-imagemin` to `package.json` in order to minify images.
- `bower.json` and `.bowerrc` with jquery.
- Base asset structure to resources directory.
- `app.js` to handle initialization of javascript modules based in the markup.
- Main _.less_ file.
- initial `gulpfile.js` to handle tasks regarding assets.
- `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml` and a 'database' directory to store database container data.

## Usage

Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) on your system.

* [Install instructions](https://docs.docker.com/installation/mac/) for Mac OS X
* [Install instructions](https://docs.docker.com/installation/ubuntulinux/) for Ubuntu Linux
* [Install instructions](https://docs.docker.com/installation/) for other platforms

Install [Docker Compose](http://docs.docker.com/compose/) on your system.

To start the containers

```bash
docker-compose build # only the first time
docker-compose up
```

If you are running the application for the first time you should
run the migrations and the default gulp task (to compile the assets)

```bash
docker exec -i -t <projectName>_web_1 composer install    # install php dependencies
docker exec -i -t <projectName>_web_1 bower install --allow-root # install front-end dependencies
docker exec -i -t <projectName>_web_1 php artisan migrate # run migrations
docker exec -i -t <projectName>_web_1 gulp                # run laravel's elixir
```

> PS: "<projectName>" is name of the directory the project is within. Docker-compose uses this convention.

Latter, you ran keep the elixir watcher running with

```bash
docker exec -i -t <projectName>_web_1 gulp watch
```

Finally, you can access the containers interactively with

```bash
docker exec -i -t <projectName>_web_1 bash # to access the web server container
docker exec -i -t <projectName>_web_1 php artisan tinker # to access Laravel's REPL
mysql --host 127.0.0.1 -u root   # to access the database
```
